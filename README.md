## Features of the Exchange app
1. User has three currency pockets EUR, GBP, USD and their respective balances, we are using initial balances for this app
    * In real scenario, we can fetch those from backend.
2. User can exchange with source and destination currency types using any of the currency pocket balance to transact.
    * User can type the amount in source pocket and see the amount in destination pocket or visa versa according to the live rate.
    * If the amount in source pocket is greater than the pocket balance for that currency, an error is shown i.e exceeds balance.
    * User can switch/swap the source and destination currency types using a switch/swap button.
    * We took an assumption that our app doesn't allow user to transfer more than 999,999,999.99 due to government regulations.
3. Exchange rate is fetched using free api https://api.exchangeratesapi.io and for demo purspose we update it every 10 seconds to let user exchange currencies at almost live rate.
    * Live exchage rate in regard to source and destination exchange currency is shown in the middle of the screen.
4. Can do a valid transaction
    * If the amount in source is less than pocket amount of that currency.
    * If the source and destination currency are different.
    * If we have the exchange rate for both currencies
    * A valid transaction shows a success notification updating the balances in both source and destination currency pocket.

## Development considerations
1. The project uses typescript with a flat folder structure to make the application simple.
2. Uses react hooks and leverage the functional programming paradigm.
2. Almost every component, action creator, reducer, hook, util has a unit test suite or integration test suite.
    * 14 test suits with 49 tests for the different areas of the application.
